# TrackDAQ
Teensy 3.6 based data logger that is meant to report back up to RaceChrono (https://racechrono.com/) app via RC3 statements over BT

The code probably already needs a bit of a re-work as closer it is to track season the more I just add code without a thought for maintenance.  And I never thought I would release it externally so readability and code consistency kinda sucks...

WORK IN PROGRESS!
